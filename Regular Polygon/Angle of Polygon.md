This is the most basic and simplest idea about a regular polygon. A regular polygon is a polygon whose all sides are equal, hence, all angles are equal. It's said to be regular n-gon if it has n sides. If it has n sides, of ocurse, it has n angles.

Now about the angles of any n-gon (regular or non-regular) , we can say, the sum of n angles of a n-gon = (n-2) * 180 degrees. 
So, for a triangle (3-gon) , sum of all angles is = (3-2)* 180 = 180; for a 4-gon it's (4-2)* 180 = 360. for a 5-gon it's (5-2)* 180 and so on.
So, in a regular n-gon, as all the angles are equal, one single angle = ((n-2)* 180)/n 
This is a very simple idea but is useful in some polygon related problems. 

One very very easy problem is https://toph.co/p/angle-of-polygon , just to get started.
